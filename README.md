# dplqr
This is the public code of the paper ``Neural Networks for Partially Linear Quantile Regression" by Qixian Zhong and Jane-Ling Wang (2023).

To get started, you first need to install python package PyTorch (https://pytorch.org) and torchtuples (https://pypi.org/project/torchtuples). 
- demo.ipynb: Jupyter file to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed DPLQR.
- dqAux.py: auxiliary functions for the DPLQR.
- data: Concrete Compressive Strength Data Set (concrete.csv), available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu.
